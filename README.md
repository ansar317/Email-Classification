# Email Classification Project

The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to identify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). The emails' text content is used to inform the predictions made by a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ansar317/email-classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd email-classification
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Making Predictions

Once the model is trained, you can make predictions on new email data. Use the provided script:

```bash
python Email Classification.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to enter email text and get predictions.

## Example

An example of using the trained model is provided in the `Email Classification.py` file. You can follow the instructions in that directory to see how the model works with your dataset.
